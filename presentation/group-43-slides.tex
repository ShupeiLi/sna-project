\note{This is a brief content of our presentation. Firstly, we will introduce some background knowledge about graph embeddings, followed by a review of related work. Then, we will explain the node2vec algorithm in detail and present experimental results in the original paper. After that, we will introduce the idea of our course project.

\note{As we've seen in this course, complex relationships can be modelled by graphs. Graph-structured data appears in many modern applications like molecular structure modelling, social network analysis, recommender system, etc. However, if we want to leverage the information contained in graphs, we need to find a way to represent graph-structured data efficiently. Traditional statistical and machine learning methods are designed for extracting features from structured data, such as PCA, UMAP, t-SNE. Although these methods have achieved satisfactory performance on grid-like data, they are hard to be generalized to graph-structured data, because they higly depend on properties of Eucildean space. This challenge led to the development of techniques specially for graph representation. The figure on the slide illustrates the general idea of graph embedding learning method. Firstly, we obtain embeddings by mapping graphs onto a low dimension space. And then, we can use these features in some downstream tasks like node classification and link prediction. From this perspective, node2vec algorithm that we address in presentation is a feature learning framework.}

\section{Related Work}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Related Work}
    A taxonomy of graph embedding techniques \footcite{murphy2022}.

\end{frame}
\note{This figure illustrates the taxonomy of graph embedding techniques, according to a textbook written by Murphy. There are two types of graph embedding techniques. They are shallow embedding method and deep embedding method. Shallow embedding methods use shallow encoding functions to map the original graph structure onto a Euclidean space and obtain the embedding matrix. If data is labelled, we can apply supervised algorithms to extract embeddings, for example, label propagation. However, labels are not avaliable or only partly avaliable in most cases, where we need to use unspervised or semi-supervised learning. These methods can be divided into distance-based method and outer product method further. Some representative algorithms are given in the figure. It is worth noting that node2vec algorithm we emphasize in presentation belongs to outer product-based method using skip-gram architecture, which is inspired by skip-gram model in natral language processing field. Deep embedding method usually refers to algorithms that learn graph features via graph neural networks, or GNN. GNN is a special class of artificial neural networks designed for graph-structured data. In our project experiments, we mainly use a method called graph convolutional networks, which is a popular GNN architecture.}

                Pr\left( n_i|f\left( u \right)  \right) = \frac{\exp\left( f\left( n_i \right) \cdot f\left( u \right)  \right) }{\sum_{v\in V}\exp\left( f\left( v \right)\cdot f\left( u \right)   \right)}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{When the original paper was published, there were no feature learning algorithms that had been used for link prediction. Therefore, authors set four heuristic scores as benchmarks. The first four lines of table shows the performance of heuristic scores. The other three benchmarks are the same as in the experiment 1. Authors tested average, hadamard, weighted-L1, and weighted-L2 operations on these three benchmarks as well as node2vec. Due to the limited space, table on the slide only shows the result of hadamard operation. We can see that the learned feature representations outperform heuristic scores. And node2vec achieves the best AUC score on all datasets.}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item During the training of node2vec, the intermediate state of node embeddings is a black box.\par
        Our solution: Visualize the node embeddings during the training of node2vec with t-SNE technique.
        \item Randomly initialized inputs in GNN affect the robustness of model performance and extend the model training time.\par
            Our solution: Propose a novel method that combines node2vec and GNN.
        \item Effectiveness of algorithms.\par
            Our solution: Evaluate node2vec, GNN, and our proposed method on five real-world data sets with metrics that are different from the original paper.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\note{Next, I will talk about our contributions in the project. Firstly, the intermediate state of node embeddings during node2vec training is a black box. We try to visualize the node embeddings with t-SNE technique to provide some insights into node2vec. Secondly, we find that researchers in graph embedding learning field have focused more on deep embedding methods these years. However, randomly initialized inputs in GNN affect the robustness of model performance and extend the training time. To address the problem, we proposed a novel method that combines node2vec and GNN. Thirdly, to further test the effectiveness of algorithms, we evaluate node2vec, GNN, and our proposed method on five real world datasets and select different metrics.}

\note{As mentioned before, random initialization in GNN may not be a good strategy. Inspired by the concept of meta learning, we use the pretrained embeddings from node2vec as the meta information for GNN. Figure on the right illustrates the architecture of our proposed model. We expect our method will accelerate the training stage of GNN and improve the model performance. We choose graph convolutional network or GCN in our experiments. The iteration formula of GCN is given on the slide. Preliminary results we have obtained so far support the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

\note{Our future work will mainly focus on two tasks. Task one, apply node2vec, GCN, and our proposed model to node classification and link prediction. Task two, try different strategies of hyperparameter tuning. Due to the time limit, we omit technical details of GNN. If you are interested in GNN, we can discuss the principle of GNN together. Thank you. This's all of our presentation. Any questions?}

            Graph Neural Network is a deep learning framework for graph.\par ~\\
            General GNN iteration formula:
            \begin{align*}
                \displaystyle
                h_u^{(k)} = \sigma (W_{\text{self}}^{(k)} h_u^{(k-1)} + W_n^{(k)}\sum_{v\in N(u)} h_v^{(k-1)} + b^{(k)} ) 
            \end{align*}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] $h_u^{(k)}$: $k$-th layer output embedding of node $u$.
                \item[] $W^{(k)}$: weights of $k$-th layer (trainable).
                \item[] $b^{(k)}$: bias of $k$-th layer (trainable).
                \item[] $\sigma$: activation function.

    \begin{align*}
        \displaystyle
        h_u^{(k)} = \sigma( W_{\text{self}}^{(k)} h_u^{(k-1)} + W_n^{(k)}\sum_{v\in N(u)} h_v^{(k-1)} + b^{(k)} ) 
    \end{align*}
    Final output embeddings can be used for calculating predictions. Then, we can use these predictions to compute the loss and optimize parameters with back propagation.\par \vspace{0.2cm}
    Problem: How to produce $h_u^0$ for each node?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Use one-hot vector for each node.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[-] Drawback: The total number of nodes is large. Using one-hot vector for each node will cause the input tensor to be very sparse.
            \end{itemize} 
        \item Transfer pretrained embeddings from other similar tasks.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[-] Drawback: There can't always be a similar task with pretrained embeddings for every network.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Use a trainable embedding layer to allocate randomly initialized embeddings for each node.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[-] Drawback: Randomly initialized embeddings could have negative impact on training process.

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Combine node2vec and GNN}
    node2vec can produce embeddings for each node with graph information.\par ~\\
    GNN lacks a good general method to initialize its input nodesâ€™ embeddings.\par ~\\
    We can use node2vec to produce initial input nodesâ€™ embeddings for GNN to improve training process of GNN and obtain better performance.\par ~\\
    Itâ€™s a general method because there is no specific requirement of graphs when applying node2vec and GNN.
